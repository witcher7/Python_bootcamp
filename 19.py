# DATA SCIENCE --> the jobs are really good in data science and AI

# NUMPY
# it is a python library which helps us in making two dimensional arrays 

# list = [1,2,3,4,5]

# numpy = [[1,2,3,4,5] , [6,7,8,9,10]]


# import numpy as np # as __ you can give any name that you like

# we are importing a book / module which will help us in doing functions

                                     # 
# food = np.array([[["Coke", "Fanta","Redbull","Sprite"], ["Burgur","Fries","Pizza","Chocolate"]],[["Football","Basketball","Tennis","Soccer"],["Ball","Basketball Court","Tennis Court", "Field"]]] )
# print(food)
# print(type(food))

 # go inside c array and find 0th array, find 1st element
