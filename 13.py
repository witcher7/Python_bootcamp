# loops are repetition of something
# # I want to repeat some sentence/ repeat my code

# for i in range(1,11):
#   # the range will work tilll n -1
             # 11 ---> 10
            # 50 ---> 49
            # 999 --> 998
              # the ending point
  # my I is working from 0 to 9  --> 10
                        # 0 to 10 --> 11
  # starting point --> 1 to 10
#   print(i)

# # 
# 1 to 85
# 1 to 16 
# -10 to 1
# -15 to -5
# -15 to 14
  
# when you are using words/ strings
# better to use normal numbers


# for i in range(10,-11,-1):
#                      # reverse order reduce -1 at every step
#   print(i)

# # 
# 110 --> 999
# 568 -->68
# 75 --> 15
# 10 --> -43
# 111 --  11

# WHILE loop

# while the condition is true, the loop will work
#otherwise it will not work

# n = 10
# while n >0: # the condition is true
#   print(n)
#   n = n-1

# n = 110
# while n<=999:
#   print(n)
#   n = n +1
