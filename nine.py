#Printing all letters except some using input from the user

# --> enter input for the letter --> Nike
# --> which element you dont want to print --> i
#   N
#   k
#   e

# functions ---> these are piece of code we make so that it can be
# used again and again
# normally it will not work until and unless we have called it

# def jerry():
#   print("Jerry")

# jerry() # name of the function 
# print("Hi")
# a = 10
# b = 20
# print(a+b)
# jerry()

def sum(a,b):
  ans = a +b
  return ans # we use return to return a value back to our main world

a = int(input("Enter number for a : "))
b = int(input("Enter number for b : "))
koffi = sum(a,b) # ans is ready to take the value from return 
print(koffi)

# make functions for them as well
# do this for mul(multiplication) ,div ( division) , sub(subtraction)
